# Create-Account--Login-and-Linking-MySQL

## Using MySQL API and MyPHP to connect and take data from user stored in server databases

*There are four main files are CreateAccount.php, Login.php, ViewAllEmployee.php and Employee

#### Create Account : Need to fill in all blank, after finished gonna be transfered to ViewAllEmployees.php but cannot see information except login
#### Login : Login by email and password, if enter wrong password or email will receive error notice, and corretc gonna be transfered to ViewAllEmployees.php. Users are able to see databases
#### Employee : This is cheating page if can not remember password or email, doing this to practice AJAX, getting information from drop-down option and compare by id then sending to GetEmployee.php to display selected Employee.
